# Master-Thesis
This is the repository of the Master Thesis project called 'Multigrid strategies for fast and accurate plasma edge simulations for nuclear fusion reactors'. The completion of this Master Thesis project is necessary to obtain the diploma of Mechanical Engineer at the Catholic University of Leuven in the year 2021.
This repository main cause is for the Matlab codes while changing and adding functions to existing code. 
It can also be used for the Latex files for the Master Thesis text, however this is probably not obligated nor necessary.
